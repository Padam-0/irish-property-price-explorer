# To Do:
  
Automated update:
  - When recaching check that the max price/date are update through the views during the 'check if use cached stage'
  
Known Bugs:
  - Related:
    - No legend on bar charts
    - Pie chart labels not wrapping upon 2nd creation
    - Both have to do with the svg not being created when the elements are 
    rendered, so measurement isn't possible

Wishlist:
  - PDF creation http://pdfmake.org/#/
  - Data download
  - Use Population density for population estimate
  - Walkthrough

In Progress:
- Pete:
  - Replace pie charts with horizontal line charts

  - cook_pop = 0 not triggering popup
  - Balance APIs
  - Change ippe.com to.ie

  - Cookies ok btn
  - Reporting Page natave starting early when date-limited search
  - No data to display on reporting page price graphs
